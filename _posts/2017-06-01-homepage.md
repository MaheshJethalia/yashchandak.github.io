I am a first year MS/PhD student in the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/)
at the [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/).
My interests are in **continual learning**, a branch of Artificial Intelligence, which aims at teaching machines
new concepts over time. My work is concentrated around the intersection of deep learning, reinforcement learning,
and online optimization. I enjoy looking out for inspirations from neuroscience as well.

I graduated from [VIT University](http://chennai.vit.ac.in/) in 2017 with Bachelors in Computer Science and
Engineering. I did my undergrad research project at [IIT-Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in) under the amazing guidance of
[Prof. B. Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/). In my Junior year, I had wonderful opportunities as an intern
 to conduct research at [Defence Research and Development Organization(IRDE, DRDO)](https://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/labs1/IRDE/English/indexnew.jsp?pg=homepage.jsp)
under Dr. J.P. Singh and later at [University of Technology, Troyes, France](http://www.utt.fr/en/index.html) with [Prof. Babiga Birregah](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qHEWWZ8AAAAJ&hl=en).
As a sophomore, I was part of a great initiative by University of California and Stanford:
[Aspiring Researcher's Challenge](https://aspiringresearchers.soe.ucsc.edu/), where I was guided by
[Prof. James Davis](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~davis/), UCSC and [Rajan Vaish](https://stanford.edu/~rvaish/), postdoc, Stanford.
