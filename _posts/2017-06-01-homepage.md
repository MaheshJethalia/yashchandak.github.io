I am a first year MS/PhD student in the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/)
at the [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). My interests are around
a branch of Artificial Intelligence known as **continual learning**. It aims at making the machines
understand new concepts over time. I work at the intersection of reinforcement learning,
  deep learning, and online optimization. Often I look out for inspirations from neuroscience as well.

I graduated from [VIT University](http://chennai.vit.ac.in/) in 2017 with bachelors in Computer Science.
I did my undergrad research project at [IIT-Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in) under the amazing guidance of
[Prof. B. Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/). In 2016, I had wonderful opportunities of doing research internships at
[Defence Research and Development Organization(IRDE, DRDO)](https://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/labs1/IRDE/English/indexnew.jsp?pg=homepage.jsp) under Dr. J.P. Singh and later at
[University of Technology, France](http://www.utt.fr/en/index.html) under [Prof. Babiga Birregah](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qHEWWZ8AAAAJ&hl=en).
As a sophomore, I was lucky to be a part of
[Aspiring Researcher's Challenge](https://aspiringresearchers.soe.ucsc.edu/) and being guided by
[Prof. James Davis](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~davis/), UCSC and [Rajan Vaish](https://stanford.edu/~rvaish/), Stanford.
