I am a first year MS/PhD student in the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/)
at the [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). My interests are primarily pivoted around
a branch of [Artificial Intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) known as **continual/lifelong learning**, which aims at making the machines progressively
understand new concepts over time. Currently, I am looking over intersection of  [deep learning](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Deep_Learning),
[reinforcement learning](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Reinforcement_learning) and [online optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_optimization)
with constant inspirations from neuroscience to take a step towards achieving that goal.

Prior to joining UMass, I graduated from [VIT University](http://chennai.vit.ac.in/) in 2017 with bachelors in Computer Science.
I spent my final undergrad semester at [IIT-Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in) doing research project under amazing guidance of
[Prof. B. Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/). I also had wonderful opportunities of doing research internships in 2016 at
[Defence Research and Development Organization(IRDE, DRDO)](https://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/labs1/IRDE/English/indexnew.jsp?pg=homepage.jsp) under Dr. J.P. Singh and later at
[University of Technology, France](http://www.utt.fr/en/index.html) under [Prof. Babiga Birregah](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qHEWWZ8AAAAJ&hl=en). During my sophomore year, I was lucky to be a part of
[Aspiring Researcher's Challenge](https://aspiringresearchers.soe.ucsc.edu/) and being guided by
[Prof. James Davis](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~davis/), UCSC and [Rajan Vaish](https://stanford.edu/~rvaish/), Stanford.
